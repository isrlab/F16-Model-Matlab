# F16-Model-Matlab
This is a Matlab/Simulink implementation of a full nonlinear F16 aircraft model. The aerodynamics included in this model come from the NASA Technical Report 1538, Simulator Study of Stall/Post-Stall Characteristics of a Fighter Airplane with Relaxed Longitudinal Static Stability, by Nguyen, Ogburn, Gilbert, Kibler, Brown, and Deal, Dec 1979. The model is based on Aircraft Control and Simulations, by Brian Stevens and Frank Lewis, Wiley Inter-Science, New York, 1992. This is a revised implementation of the older implementation available at  [MATLAB/Simulink package](https://dept.aem.umn.edu/~balas/darpa_sec/SEC.Software.html).

To get started, run runF16.m. This simulates the open-loop dynamics of the F16 Model. Trim and linearization can be done using [Simulink's Control System Design and Analysis Apps](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simcontrol.html).
